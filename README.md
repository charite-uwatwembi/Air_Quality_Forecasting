Ihave an assignment, and here are
Air Quality Forecasting
This is your first graded assignment for the Machine Learning Techniques I course. It focuses on applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to solve a real-world problem: forecasting air pollution levels. Air pollution, particularly PM2.5, is a critical global issue that impacts public health and urban planning. By accurately predicting PM2.5 concentrations, governments and communities can take timely action to mitigate its effects.

This project aims to predict PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using historical air quality and weather data. You will:

Preprocess sequential data to uncover patterns.
Design and train RNN or LSTM models to make accurate predictions.
Fine-tune the model and run several experiments. the goal is to be at the top of the leaderboard.
Submission Requirements
Submit a comprehensive report.
Introduction: Briefly describe the problem and your approach.

Data Exploration: Summarize your analysis of the dataset, including any preprocessing steps.

Model Design: Describe the architecture of your RNN/LSTM model that gave you the best performance and why you chose it.

Experiment Table: Include a table summarizing your experiments. The table must have the following columns. The parameters column should include more parameters and not only the learning rate as demonstrated.

Experiment # 	Parameters	Model Architecture	Output (RMSE)
1	Learning rate = 0.01	Single LSTM layer, 128 units	35.45
2	Learning rate = 0.001	Two LSTM layers, 64 units	29.87
Results: Discuss your modelâ€™s performance and any key findings.

Conclusion: Summarize your work and propose improvements or next steps.

 Include the GitHub repo link in your report. Make sure your code is well documented.
